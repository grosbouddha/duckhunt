DuckHunt
=============

WAT?
----
A remake of the classic [DuckHunt NES game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-daxzVxrQI)) implemented using the HTML5 canvas element.

You can play it here: [Play](http://grosbouddha.github.io/duckhunt/)

What's inside?
--------------

* [cake.js](https://code.google.com/p/cakejs/) - a canvas animation framework (using a scene paradigm)
* [Yahoo! UI library](http://yuilibrary.com/) - for all the internal architecture plumbing 
* [SoundManager2](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/) - for everything sound/music related
* assets from Nintendo

Documentation
-------------
* Read my ugly code
* A [quick prez](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l8L7YztWLHbxU8j_E1InVYaXufH76ghRVcmMTZuJBs0/edit?usp=sharing&authkey=COmsiZAL) when I showed this game at [JS-Montreal](http://js-montreal.org/)

Expectations
------------

This mini-project was made few years ago and just to kill some time.
Don't expect it to be too stable or using top-notch library updates and tricks.
